# Contacts: registration through addressed contacts, its revision, and reference pairs

General laws of which the contact plans of `Becoming.ReferencePlan` and
`Becoming.ContinuingRevision` are instances. A registration reads signals at a finite list of
addresses (its contacts); two signals are alike where they agree at every contact. Nothing is
assumed beyond decidable equality of addresses.

* **What a plan registers.** Registration through a plan is the shared agreement on data
  (`Learning.Training.AgreeOn`), the data being the contacts. For any decided data, the
  selection of a signal's value at an address is through agreement on the data exactly where
  the address is in the data (`through_data_iff`), and a change of data keeps every old
  selection exactly where it retains the old data (`keeps_data_iff`, `survive_data_iff`). For
  plans: a selection at an address is through the plan exactly where the plan contacts it
  (`through_at_iff`). A change of plan keeps every old selection exactly where it retains every
  old contact (`keeps_iff_retains`, `selections_survive_iff`, by `Registration.keeps_iff`); a retired
  contact loses its selection (`retired_loses`), an added one gains it (`added_gains`). Along
  every trace whose steps retain contacts, all selections are kept (`trace_keeps_of_retains`).
* **Revision that reads its consequences.** A rule forming the next plan from the present plan
  and the address at which the last activity failed answers every failure, in the sense that
  the next plan registers the failed address, exactly where its output contains that address
  (`answers_iff`). A rule that does not read the failure (`Blind`) answers every failure
  exactly where its plan contacts every address (`blind_answers_iff`); where no list holds
  every address (`Unlisted`, as for `Nat`), every blind rule leaves, at every plan, some
  failure unanswered (`blind_misses`). With finitely many addresses the converse fails
  (`finite_blind_answers`).
* **Reference pairs.** Two reference responses of a two-valued channel, used as the encoding
  `pick`, drive it to both targets exactly when they differ (`drives_iff`). An installed
  encoding stays right across a change of channel exactly where the new channel agrees with
  the old at the encoded inputs (`stays_iff`); an inverted channel fails at every target
  (`inverted_fails`).

No ethical predicate, ranking or axiom occurs.
