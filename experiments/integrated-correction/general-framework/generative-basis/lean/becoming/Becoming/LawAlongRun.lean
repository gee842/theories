# A law along one run, under a relation

`Becoming.Mechanism` characterized when a projection carries a law over every configuration
(`carries_law_iff`: configurations alike go alike). This module states the criterion along one
run, once, under a relation, and reads it through the three relations the spine uses: a
projection, what a formation couples into with fixed conditions, and what it couples into with
dependences that change along the run. It also states the bridge to `GenerativeCore`'s exact
projection of finite paths (`Generative.projection_exact_iff`). No premise enters beyond what each
theorem names.

* **The law, under a relation.** A run's steps before `t` are consistent under a relation `E`
  when any two of them from configurations `E` relates, by the same move, reach configurations `E`
  relates (`Run.ConsistentUnder`). Where `E` is an equivalence, some process going alike under `E`
  (`GoAlikeUnder` of `Becoming.Laws`, through the identity) admits the run's steps before `t`
  exactly where they are consistent (`Run.law_under_iff`). The witness is the record read under
  `E` (`Run.recordUnder`); the forward direction needs no equivalence. Consistency up to a step
  holds at every earlier step, so once failed the criterion fails from then on
  (`Run.ConsistentUnder.earlier`, `Run.no_law_under_later`). Where the process goes alike under
  `E`, every run is consistent (`Run.consistentUnder_of_goAlikeUnder`). Consistency reads `E` only
  on the run's configurations up to `t` (`Run.consistentUnder_congr`).
* **Reading 1: through a projection.** Under equal projections the criterion is
  `Run.ConsistentThrough` (`Run.consistentUnder_eq_iff`), and it gives a determined process on the
  description itself: some determined process on the description admits the run's steps before
  `t` read through `π` exactly where they are consistent (`Run.law_through_iff`, from
  `Run.law_under_iff` through the image). The record read through `π` (`Run.recordThrough`) is the
  least process admitting those steps (`Run.record_least`) and is determined exactly where they
  are consistent (`Run.record_determined_iff`); once failed, failed from then on
  (`Run.no_law_later`). `Becoming.Unfolding` stated the case through the identity over the whole
  history (`Consistent`, `exists_law_iff`); it is the instance at every step
  (`Run.consistent_id_iff`). Where configurations alike go alike, every run is consistent
  (`Run.consistent_of_goAlike`, the case of `Run.consistentUnder_of_goAlikeUnder`). The converse
  fails: in `Constant` a run consistent at every step lies in a process that does not go alike
  (`Constant.consistent`, `Constant.not_goAlike`); `Switching.no_state_law` follows from the
  criterion (`Switching.inconsistent`).
* **Reading 2: through coupling that changes along the run.** With dependences read off the
  configuration (`Dependence`), two configurations are alike in what `g` couples into when the
  levels at each, read through the dependence `g` has there, admit it alike and the conditions it
  observes stand alike (`Dependence.AlikeAt`). This is an equivalence
  (`Dependence.alikeAt_equivalence`), so the law holds through it (`Run.law_through_dependence_iff`).
  Along a run it is the relation between two steps each read through the dependence of its own step
  (`Web.AlikeAcross`, `Dependence.alikeAt_iff_alikeAcross`). `Web.AlikeThrough` of
  `Becoming.Testing`, read at step `t` between the levels standing at two steps, is the coupling with
  the dependence fixed at the configuration of step `t` (`Dependence.fixedAt`,
  `Dependence.alikeThrough_iff_fixedAt`, `Web.alikeAcross_iff_alikeThrough`).
* **Reading 3: through coupling with fixed conditions.** Fixed conditions (`Conditions` of
  `Becoming.Renewal`) are the case of reading 2 whose dependences do not change
  (`Conditions.AlikeAt` is `Dependence.AlikeAt` of `Conditions.dependence`,
  `Dependence.conditions_alikeAt_iff`, along a run `Run.consistent_conditions_iff`), exactly
  `Web.AlikeThrough` on the runs read through the conditions (`Conditions.alikeThrough_iff`,
  `Conditions.alikeAt_iff_alikeThrough`), so `Run.law_through_coupling_iff`. Where `g`'s
  dependences up to `t` are those of one step (`Dependence.Unchanged`), readings 2 and 3 give one
  criterion (`Run.consistent_unchanged_iff`); where they form or dissolve, neither gives the other
  (`Changing`).
* **Exactness, over every configuration.** The image of a process through `π` represents every
  finite path exactly, in the sense of `Generative.projection_exact_iff`, exactly where
  configurations alike under `π` match each other's steps up to `π` (`MatchesThrough`,
  `image_exact_iff`). Some determined process on the description both admits every step read
  through `π` and represents every finite path exactly where configurations alike go alike and
  match each other's steps (`exact_law_iff`). This is a statement of the whole process, not of one
  run; going alike does not give it (`Stuck.goAlike_not_matches`), and `Coarse` is exact through
  its first bit (`Coarse.matching`, `Coarse.exact_law`).
* **Witnesses for the coupling readings.** In `Unseen` the process is determined, and a formation
  depending on one condition and observing nothing couples alike the first two steps of a run that
  by the same move lead to configurations it couples apart: the level it does not couple into
  decides (`Unseen.determined`, `Unseen.inconsistent`, `Unseen.no_law`); observing that level, the
  same run is consistent at every step (`Unseen.consistent_observing`). In `Changing`, a level rising
  by one each step, a dependence that dissolves across the first step leaves the run consistent
  under the changing coupling while the coupling fixed at the start is inconsistent at step 2
  (`Changing.dissolving_consistent`, `Changing.dissolving_fixed_inconsistent`), and a dependence that
  forms does the reverse at step 3 (`Changing.forming_fixed_consistent`,
  `Changing.forming_inconsistent`).

**Reading (the AI's).** A run is evidence of a law under a relation exactly as far as its own
steps agree with each other: the record is the least candidate, and it is a law exactly where no
two recorded occasions the relation joins went apart. Which relation is read is the one choice: a
description, what a formation couples into with the dependences of one moment, or what it couples
into on each occasion. What the run never visits it does not test, so a run can show a law where
the process has none; a difference outside the coupling can decide what the formation next couples
into, so no law at its coupling holds along that course however determined the unfolding is; and
reading a course through the dependence of one moment can find a law the formation's own coupling
does not carry, or miss one it does. A law at a description is also not yet a faithful model of
finite paths: that needs every configuration of a class to be able to do what any of them did.

What is not derived: which relation an actual unfolding carries a law through; that any formation
forms or uses one; observation that changes along the run (here what a formation observes is
fixed, as in `Becoming.Testing`); how many steps settle whether a law holds. No ethical predicate,
ranking or axiom occurs.
