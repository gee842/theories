# Onward: where a run goes on

`Becoming.Branching` states laws along runs: merging nothing within finitely many
configurations, a run comes back and the configuration it starts from returns; nothing rises
along it; a configuration that never returns needs openness. Each takes the run as given.
Building a run from a configuration that can move takes a continuation at every step, and taking
one at every step is a selection the core does not assume. This module states where a run goes on
with nothing selected, and what a run takes where nothing else gives one.

* **Within finitely many configurations, a run is a course into a return.** Where a list holds
  every configuration, a course as long as the list repeats a configuration, which returns
  (`returning_of_continues`). From where a course leads to a configuration that returns, a run
  starts: round the return, preceded by the course (`run_of_returning`, `run_of_reach`). So a run
  starts at a configuration exactly where a course as long as the list does
  (`run_iff_continues`), exactly where courses of every length do (`run_iff_unbounded`), and
  exactly where a course leads to a return (`run_iff_returning`). No decision and no selection
  is used. Where the successors are also listed, whether a run starts is decided
  (`run_decided`). Where branching is infinite, courses of every length do not give a run
  (`fan_no_run`).
* **A family that keeps moving.** A family keeps moving where from each member some step leads
  to a member (`KeepsMoving`); the steps within it form a process (`within`). Within finitely
  many configurations, a run starts at each member and stays in the family
  (`KeepsMoving.run`).
* **The laws along runs, with no run given.** Merging nothing within finitely many
  configurations, a configuration returns exactly where a course as long as the list starts from
  it (`lossless_returns_iff`), so each member of a family that keeps moving returns
  (`KeepsMoving.returns`); a quantity that never falls across a step within the family keeps its
  value across each such step (`lossless_no_rise`), so a rise within it needs a merge
  (`rise_needs_merge`); and a configuration with courses of every length that never returns
  needs openness (`lossless_unlisted`). These are `Branching`'s laws along runs
  (`Lossless.returns`, `Lossless.no_rise`, `rise_not_lossless`, `Lossless.unlisted`) stated for
  every configuration from which the process can keep moving.
* **Searched moves.** Where a test recognizes, among enumerated moves, a step that stays in the
  family wherever there is one (`Finds`), a run is built as data, with no selection: the test is
  searched until it passes (`search`, through accessibility, `searchFrom`), each step is taken
  that way (`searchedStep`), and the run starts at the member and stays in the family
  (`searchedRun`, `searchedRun_start`, `searchedRun_within`). Where the steps and the family
  are decided and the steps' moves are enumerated, testing each enumerated move is such a test
  (`decidedTest`, `decidedTest_finds`).
* **What a run takes in general.** A run from every member of every family that keeps moving,
  asked of every process, is exactly the principle that a total relation has a sequence along it
  from every start (`DependentSelection`; standard name: dependent choice) (`runs_iff_selection`).

**Readings (the AI's, pending Ren).**
- Within finitely many configurations, whatever goes on without end does so by coming round: the
  course itself shows where it returns, and the run goes round there. Nothing is selected and
  nothing decided; going on is read off the unfolding.
- Where the configurations are not bounded, going on without end is given where the moves can be
  searched; asked of every process, that every configuration that can keep moving starts a run
  is exactly dependent choice.

What is not derived: whether the core gives `DependentSelection` (a statement about the theory,
needing a model outside it); runs along unbounded configurations where the branching is finite
and nothing is searched, given in `Becoming.Lasting` through `EitherThroughout` and a selection
(`Lasting.lifting`); the laws along runs where nothing lists the configurations. No ethical
predicate, ranking or axiom occurs.

**Classical sources.** Within finitely many configurations a run is a lasso: a course into a
cycle, found by the pigeonhole principle (`revisits_within` of `Becoming.Recurrence`). The fan
(`fan_no_run`) is the failure of König's lemma (König 1927) without finite branching: courses of
every length give no infinite path. König's lemma itself, for finite branching over unbounded
configurations, is not stated here; it is not constructive in general, and weak König's lemma is
equivalent to `LLPO` (Ishihara 1990; Bridges and Richman 1987), the principle `EitherThroughout`
that `Becoming.Lasting` uses for lifting (`eitherThroughout_iff_llpoForDecided`). `DependentSelection` is the axiom of dependent choice (Bernays 1942), and
`runs_iff_selection` states it as exactly what runs from every family that keeps moving take, at
`Type 0`.
