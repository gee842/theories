# Reconfiguration: fault envelopes induced by causes, and the step that installs a new roster

Each member of a roster fails according to a formula over root causes (`FaultFormula`, `fails`);
supplied bounds on the root causes that may occur together then induce the fault sets of the
roster (`induced`, `envelope`), so the envelope of `FaultEnvelopes` is derived from causes rather
than listed. An arrangement is ready where its bounds are not empty and every two of them leave
a member working under both (`ready`). A reconfiguration installs a candidate arrangement where
the step is opened, the candidate is ready, and the reserve and time cover the step's own draw
together with the candidate's response load; it renews the epoch and the serial and draws its
amount (`reconfigure`).

* **Induced envelopes.** Failure is monotone in the root causes (`fails_mono`,
  `survives_of_included`, `induced_mono`), so a member outside the faults a bound induces works
  under every covered set of causes (`outside_bound_survives`). A certificate over the induced
  envelope is sound for covered causes (`induced_certificate_sound`); readiness is exactly a
  nonempty separated induced envelope (`ready_separates`, `ready_iff_nonempty_separated`), which
  makes the certificate available (`induced_certificate_available`) and, with faithful members,
  completes a guarded correction within the scope (`induced_completes`).
* **The step.** Every step installs the candidate, keeps scope and tree, renews epoch and serial,
  unsigns, draws its amount and leaves reserve and time for the response
  (`reconfigure_renews`); it keeps what the scope permits (`reconfigure_keeps_scope`), stales the
  previous epoch's requests (`reconfigure_stales_epoch`), covers every shorter route
  (`reconfigure_covers_shorter`) and, with faithful members, completes a correction
  (`reconfigure_then_completes`); a closed step or an unready candidate has none
  (`closed_rejected`, `unready_rejected`).
* **As a process.** The step is a process on managed installations whose actions are
  rearrangements (`process`, `step_iff`, `enabled_iff`); the laws above are its laws
  (`closed_no_step`, `unready_no_step`, `step_renews`, `step_separated`, `step_keeps_scope`,
  `step_stales_old_epoch`, `step_certificate_available`, `step_then_completes`).
* **Computed cases.** Envelopes induced by separate, merged and repaired causes; two members of one
  cause are not redundant; a stale envelope accepts support a shared cause controls; the process
  has no step to a roster sharing a cause and a step to the repaired roster, after which the old
  approvals fail and the surviving members complete the shutdown; the step's own draw alone is not
  enough, the combined draw is; and a cause the formulas omit still breaks the model.

The formulas are supplied upper bounds, not discovered causal laws; the protected monitor, the
opening of the step and the correspondence remain premises; no network agreement, physical
migration or warrant of the rearrangement is derived. This states `CorrectionReconfiguration`
(8 October) and its joins `ReconfigurationProcesses` and `ReconfigurationProcessesInherited` in
the core (board item F3C, 18 October 2026), with the words of exchange replaced: `authorized` is
`opened`, `cost` is `amount`, `responseCost` is `responseLoad`, `mandate` is `scope`. No premise;
every declaration has an empty axiom report.
