# Histories as ideals of their finite stretches

`Becoming.Ideals` reads a history off its finite stretches as an ideal of their order. Here the
stretches are those of the core's runs and words, and the laws of what a finite history refutes
(`Becoming.Horizon`) are a case of the laws of ideals.

**Runs.** A stretch of the runs of a process is a run and a horizon, read as the run's
configurations up to the horizon and its actions before it; one stretch extends another where its
horizon is at least as late and the two runs agree up to the earlier one (`stretchOrder`). A run is
read as the ideal of the stretches it passes through (`Run.stretches`). Two runs give ideals one
below the other exactly where they agree at every horizon (`Run.stretches_le_iff`), and no run's
ideal is a finite history (`Run.stretches_not_principal`): runs are the unending histories. With no
premise:
* a reading of runs is refutable exactly where it is refutable at a stretch
  (`refutable_iff_refutableBy`), and a run adheres to a reading exactly where it adheres through its
  stretches (`adheres_iff_adheresBy`), that is, where its ideal lies in the hull of the ideals of
  the reading's runs (`adheres_iff_hull`). So Horizon's laws are the case of runs of the laws of
  `Ideals.RefutableBy` and `Ideals.AdheresBy`, derived from them below (`Stretches`);
* a reading of runs holding every run that adheres to it is the reading of the runs whose
  stretches all lie in a lower set of stretches, the stretches of the runs it holds
  (`closed_iff_within_lower`): it is made of tests, one for each stretch, read as propositions.
  Where the tests are Boolean and fixed by prefixes, refutability needs Markov's principle
  (`refutable_passes_iff_markov`);
* asked of every process, a refutable reading holds at every run adhering to it exactly under
  double-negation elimination (`refutable_holds_iff`): in the process of the Boolean sequences,
  the run of `false` adheres to "some move is `true`, or `φ`", which is refutable once `¬ ¬ φ`.
  Stability is exactly what removing the double negation needs.
* for the sequences, a run passes through a stretch exactly where the stretch's word is an initial
  word of its moves (`sequence_stretch_iff`): the run case and the word case below are one order
  read two ways.

**Words.** Finite courses of moves, the core's words, are ordered by prefix (`prefixOrder`). A
sequence of moves is read as the ideal of its initial words (`traceIdeal`), a word as the ideal of
its prefixes. A history is finite or infinite (`History`); its ideal (`historyIdeal`) is below
another's exactly where it is a prefix of it (`history_le_iff`): a word of a word as a prefix, a
word of a sequence as an initial word, a sequence of a sequence where they agree at every place;
no sequence is below a word. Two histories give ideals with the same words exactly where they are
the same history (`historyIdeal_same_iff`).

**Which ideals are histories.** An ideal of words with a longest word is a finite history
(`settles_principal`); one with words longer than every length, a word of each length picked, is
an infinite history, whose move at each place is the move there of the word picked for it
(`goesOn_trace`); so an ideal that settles, or goes on with its words picked, is a history
(`classification`). Telling which is deciding whether the history goes on: on the histories of `()`
cut at the first `true` of a Boolean sequence (`cut`), settling or going on is exactly the limited
principle of omniscience (`cut_decided_iff_lpo`). And going on gives a word of each length only
as a proposition; reading the infinite history off them takes the words given.

**Classes of histories.** A prefix-closed language (`HistoryLanguages.PrefixClosed`) is a lower set
of words (`prefixClosed_iff_lower`), so the histories within it are a closed class; a finite
history lies within it where its word is in the language, an infinite one where each of its
initial words is (`history_within_iff`). The class of the finite histories and of the infinite
histories of a property of sequences (`FiniteOr`) has every ideal in its hull (`finiteOr_hull`), so
a sequence outside the property shows the class is not refutable (`finiteOr_not_refutable`).
Recurrence is the case, by the sequence of `false` (`finiteOr_recurs_not_refutable`), as on runs
(`Sequences.recurs_not_refutable`).

**The laws of ideals on the histories of a process** (`Stretches`). The ideals of `stretchOrder P`
are the histories of the process `P`: the principal ideals are its finite histories, and its runs
are the ideals of the stretches they pass through. Each law of `Becoming.Ideals` is read on them,
with no premise:
* Horizon's laws follow from the laws of points (`Stretches.not_not`, `Stretches.adheres_least`,
  `Stretches.adheres_iff`, `Stretches.not_refutable_of_adheres`, `Stretches.refutable_adheres_iff`),
  and a refutable class of histories is refutable at runs (`refutable_of_class`);
* adhering is the least closed class: a run adheres to a reading exactly where every closed class
  of histories holding the reading's runs holds it, with no double negation (`adheres_iff_closed`);
  that class is unique (`adherence_unique`), adds no stretch (`adheres_content`) and extends any
  two of a run's stretches by one stretch of one of the reading's runs (`adheres_joint`);
* a run lies in a closed class exactly where each of its stretches is a stretch of a history of the
  class (`closed_runs`), and the runs within a lower set of stretches are refutable where every
  history leaving the set shows a stretch outside it (`within_refutable`). Asked of every process,
  a refutable class is closed, and a closed class refutable, each exactly under double-negation
  elimination, with witnesses on the process of `()`s (`Stretches.refutable_closed_iff`,
  `Stretches.closed_refutable_iff`): not being refuted by any finite stretch is not belonging, and
  a history known not to lie within a closed class does not thereby show the stretch at which it
  leaves;
* avoiding a set of stretches is closed with no double negation (`avoids_adheres`), fixed by the
  finite histories (`avoids_runs`), and refutable wherever a history failing to avoid the set holds
  a stretch of it (`avoids_refutable`);
* a lower set of stretches has the process's histories within it as its own (`inherited_histories`),
  ordered as the runs are (`within_order_iff`);
* the completion at runs: no run is compact (`run_not_compact`); a continuous reading of the
  histories is fixed at every run by its values on finite histories (`run_reading_unique`); finite
  stretches tell runs apart (`runs_told_apart`); the finite histories are a compact basis
  (`finite_basis`), and the histories are the completion of the stretches (`histories_representation`);
* which histories are runs: one that settles is a finite history (`Stretches.settles_principal`);
  one going on, with a stretch beyond each horizon picked, is the history of the run read off the
  picks (`pickedRun`, `goesOn_run`). So the classification holds for every process
  (`Stretches.classification`), and on the cut histories of the process of `()`s telling which is
  the limited principle of omniscience (`Stretches.cut_decided_iff_lpo`);
* for the process of all sequences, the runs' histories are the infinite histories of words, in
  order (`sequences_le_iff`), sameness (`sequences_same_iff`) and prefix-closed languages
  (`sequences_within_iff`).

This module states in the core what `HistoryIdeals` (7 October 2026, the completion package)
proved on its own words with `Std` and classical reasoning; there the decision of settling and the
picking of words were taken by excluded middle and choice. No ethical predicate, ranking or axiom
occurs; every declaration has an empty axiom report.
